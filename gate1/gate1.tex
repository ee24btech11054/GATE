    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Starting from design condition and keeping the mass flow rate constant, if the blade RPM is increased, the compressor rotor may experience positive incidence flow separation (actual relative flow angle greater than the design blade angle)
        \item Starting from design condition at the same blade RPM, if the mass flow rate is increased, the compressor rotor may experience positive incidence flow separation (actual relative flow angle greater than the design blade angle)
        \item Keeping the mass flow rate constant, if the blade RPM is increased, the compressor may experience surge

    \item The state of stress at a point is caused by two separate loading cases. One of them produces a pure uniaxial tension along the $x'$ direction, and the other one produces a pure uniaxial compression along the $y'$ direction, as shown in the figure. The sum of maximum and minimum principal stresses for the resultant state of stress caused by both loads acting simultaneously is $\rule{3cm}{0.15mm}$ N/mm$^2$ (rounded off to 1 decimal place).
